            I am a 39 years old Web Developer living in Weeze (North Rhine Westphalia) with experience in building web apps with
            JavaScript & Angular.<br>
            Always fascinated by the possibilities of modern web development I decided to turn my first knowledge of
            coding into the ability of creating professional web-based applications.<br>
            I reached this goal during my time at the Developer Akademie this year by using common coding practices and techniques
            in many practical exercises and projects, which have been approved by experienced mentors. My coding skills have improved significantly over the past few months thanks to this continuous process of
            absorbing new knowledge from various projects.
            <br><br>
            I invite you to take a look at my selection of responsive websites and apps I created.
